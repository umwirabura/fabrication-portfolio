## Tools & Technologies

- **MkDocs** - Static site generator
- **Material for MkDocs** - Modern documentation theme
- **Git** - Version control system
- **GitHub** - Code hosting and collaboration platform
- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD automation

## Why This Matters

Good documentation is not an afterthought—it's an integral part of the design process. For IoT systems, where hardware, software, and firmware interact, clear documentation ensures that designs are reproducible, maintainable, and scalable.

## Documentation as a Learning Tool

Throughout this course, documentation serves multiple purposes:

1. **Process Recording** - Capturing design decisions and iterations
2. **Knowledge Retention** - Creating a personal reference library
3. **Portfolio Building** - Showcasing technical capabilities
4. **Peer Learning** - Sharing insights with classmates
